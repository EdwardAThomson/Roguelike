## 🔧 Development

### Architecture

The game follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Game Loop**: Handles updates and rendering
- **State Management**: Manages game states (playing, paused, game over)
- **Entity System**: Player, monsters, and items
- **World System**: Dungeon generation and world management
- **UI System**: User interface components
- **Input System**: Input handling and key bindings

### Key Components

- **GameStateManager**: Manages overall game state
- **CameraManager**: Handles viewport and camera movement
- **FOVManager**: Calculates field of view and visibility
- **CombatManager**: Handles all combat interactions
- **WorldManager**: Manages world sections and transitions
- **ItemManager**: Handles item interactions and inventory
