## 2025-10-22 - Spellbook Modal, Visual Effects, & Stat System Overhaul

### 1. Spellbook Separated into Dedicated Modal
- **Problem**: Spellbook was integrated into Character Sheet, making spell management cluttered
- **Solution**: Created standalone Spellbook modal accessible via B key
- **Implementation**:
  - Converted `SpellbookUI` to full-screen modal (like Inventory)
  - Added header with title and close button
  - Manages own open/close state and game pause
  - Auto-initializes in constructor
- **Character Sheet Changes**: Removed Spellbook tab, kept only Attributes and Skills
- **UI Integration**: Added emergency "üìñ Spellbook" button, updated help screen
- **Benefits**: Better UX with dedicated space, cleaner Character Sheet, scalable for future features

### 2. Spell Visual Effects System Fixed
- **Critical Bug**: Spells were doing instant damage without any visual projectiles
- **Root Cause**: `inputManager.js` was bypassing the `Spell.cast()` method entirely
- **Solution**: Modified spell casting to use proper `Spell.cast()` method which:
  - Creates visual projectiles with symbols and colors
  - Animates them traveling across screen using Bresenham's algorithm
  - Handles collision detection during travel
  - Supports AoE explosions (Fireball)
  - Applies status effects (burning, freezing, etc.)
- **Visual Effects Now Working**:
  - Magic Dart: Cyan arrow `‚Üí` at speed 2
  - Magic Missile: Purple dot `‚Ä¢` at speed 1
  - Fireball: Red-orange circle `‚óè` with AoE explosion
  - Ice Shard: Cyan diamond `‚óÜ` at speed 1
  - Lightning Bolt: Yellow zigzag `~` at speed 3
- **System Architecture**: ProjectileManager ‚Üí Projectile ‚Üí Renderer ‚Üí Collision Detection
- **Files Modified**: `/src/js/modules/inputManager.js`

### 3. Projectile System Bug Fixes
- **Monster Death Error**: `entity.die is not a function`
  - **Cause**: ProjectileManager tried calling non-existent `die()` method
  - **Fix**: Use `takeDamage()` method which returns `{damage, isDead}` result
  - **Added**: Proper XP gain, loot drops, and monster removal on spell kills
- **Healing Spell Error**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'max')`
  - **Cause**: Old format used `spell.healing.min/max`, new format uses `baseDamage`
  - **Fix**: Updated to use `spell.calculateDamage()` for new Spell class instances
  - **Result**: Healing now scales with intelligence and level properly

### 4. Stat System Overhaul
- **Equipment Bonus Bug**: Staff +2 intelligence not counting for spell requirements
  - **Problem**: `Spell.canCast()` only checked base intelligence, ignored equipment
  - **Fix**: Modified to use `getSummary()` for total intelligence (base + bonuses)
  - **Impact**: Equipment bonuses now properly count for spell requirements
- **Stat Point Allocation UI Added**:
  - **Problem**: Players gained stat points on level up but had no way to spend them
  - **Solution**: Added stat allocation UI to Character Sheet Attributes tab
  - **Features**:
    - Shows "Stat Points Available" counter
    - Green `+` buttons next to each attribute
    - Click to increase stat permanently
    - Visual confirmation messages
  - **Implementation**: Added `allocateStat()` method and `.stat-button` CSS styling
- **Stat Effects**:
  - Strength: Attack power, carrying capacity
  - Dexterity: Hit chance, dodge chance
  - Constitution: Max health, resistance
  - Intelligence: Spell damage, mana pool, spell requirements

### 5. Scroll System Improvements
- **Utility Scrolls Now Stackable**:
  - Scroll of Identify: `stackable: true`
  - Scroll of Teleport: `stackable: true`
- **Spell Scrolls Remain Non-Stackable**:
  - Teach permanent spells (Magic Dart, Fireball, Heal, etc.)
  - Each is unique, consumed on use
  - Stacking doesn't make sense for one-time unlocks
- **Inventory Display**: Shows quantity for stacked items (e.g., "Scroll of Identify x3")

### 6. Visual Polish
- **Gate Labels Removed**:
  - Removed "‚Üí section (x, y)" text from gate tiles
  - Removed direction letters (N, S, E, W) from off-screen indicators
  - Kept: ‚çü gate symbol and golden arrow indicators
  - **Result**: Much cleaner, professional look without debug-style text

### 7. Code Cleanup
- **PreparedSpellManager Removed**:
  - **Status**: Dead code from old spell system
  - **Old System**: Players "prepared" one spell and cast with Z key
  - **Current System**: Spellbook with 5 hotkey slots (Q, R, F, V, X)
  - **Action**: Removed import and instantiation from `main.js`
  - **File**: `/src/js/modules/magic/preparedSpellManager.js` can be safely deleted

### 8. Technical Implementation
- **Files Modified**:
  - `/src/js/modules/ui/spellbookUI.js` - Converted to standalone modal
  - `/src/js/modules/inputManager.js` - B key handling, spell casting fixes
  - `/src/js/modules/ui/gameUI.js` - Removed spellbook tab, added stat allocation UI

  - `/src/js/modules/sprites.js` - Removed gate text labels
  - `/src/js/modules/renderer.js` - Removed gate direction letters
  - `/src/js/main.js` - Removed PreparedSpellManager

### 9. Player Experience Impact
- **Spell Casting**: Now visually engaging with animated projectiles
- **Character Progression**: Stats actually increase with levels via allocation
- **Equipment Value**: Bonuses properly count toward spell requirements
- **Inventory Management**: Utility scrolls stack, reducing clutter
- **Visual Clarity**: Cleaner UI without debug text on gates
- **Spell Management**: Dedicated spellbook modal provides better UX

### 10. Documentation Created

## 2025-07-06 - Equipment Bonus System Overhaul & Amulet Health Fix

### 1. Critical Equipment Bonus Bug Discovery
- **Issue**: Amulet of Health (+15 max health) and other equipment bonuses not applying properly
- **Root Cause**: Equipment system applied bonuses directly to `maxHealth`, then `updateStats()` immediately overwrote them
- **Sequence**: `applyStats()` ‚Üí `entity.maxHealth += 15` ‚Üí `updateStats()` ‚Üí `calculateMaxHealth()` ‚Üí bonus lost
- **Impact**: All equipment health/mana bonuses were non-functional, making accessories nearly useless

### 2. Equipment Calculation System Redesign
- **Architecture Change**: Moved from direct stat modification to calculation-based approach
- **New Player Methods**:
  - `calculateMaxHealth()` - includes equipment health bonuses
  - `calculateMaxMana()` - includes equipment mana bonuses
  - Matches existing pattern of `calculateAttackPower()` and `calculateDefense()`
- **Consistency**: All equipment bonuses now calculated uniformly instead of mixed approaches

### 3. Equipment.js Stat Application Refactor
- **Removed Direct Modification**: No longer directly modifies `maxHealth` or `maxMana` properties
- **Preserved Base Stats**: Still directly modifies strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence
- **Smart Clamping**: Added health/mana clamping when equipment is unequipped
- **Clean Architecture**: Equipment effects now properly isolated from base character stats

### 4. UI Enhancement: Equipment Bonus Visibility
- **Character Screen Updates**: Added green equipment bonus indicators
  - Health: `45 / 50 (+15)` - shows amulet bonus
  - Mana: `25 / 35 (+15)` - shows staff/tome bonuses

## 2025-07-05 - Critical Health Potion System Fixes & Inventory UI Improvements

### 1. Player Entity Initialization Bug
- **Issue**: Player character had `undefined` name property causing "undefined uses Health Potion" messages
- **Root Cause**: Character constructor didn't set a name property, Player constructor inherited this issue
- **Fix**: Added `this.name = 'Player'` to Player constructor after calling `super()`
- **Impact**: All entity references now display correctly in combat and item usage messages

### 2. Health Potion Inheritance System Breakdown
- **Critical Discovery**: Item inheritance system was fundamentally broken due to cloning process
- **Issue**: `ItemDatabase.getItem()` calls `item.clone()` which creates base `Item` instances, not `HealthPotion` instances
- **Result**: `HealthPotion.use()` method never gets called - only base `Item.use()` executes
- **Implications**: All specialized item behavior (healing, consumption) was non-functional

### 3. Health Potion Functionality Restoration
- **Problem**: Healing code was previously removed as "duplicate" but was actually the only working healing
- **Solution**: Restored direct healing logic in `Player.useItemFromInventory()`:
  - `this.health = Math.min(this.health + item.stats.healAmount, this.maxHealth)`
  - Added mana restoration: `this.mana = Math.min(this.mana + item.stats.manaRestore, this.maxMana)`
- **Workaround**: Bypassed broken inheritance by implementing functionality directly in player class

### 4. Item Consumption System Fix
- **Issue**: Potions had infinite uses due to consumption logic being in unreachable `HealthPotion.use()` method
- **Solution**: Added consumption logic to `Player.useItemFromInventory()`:
  - For stackable items with quantity > 1: `item.quantity--`
  - For single items or last in stack: `this.inventory.removeItem(index)`
- **Result**: Potions now properly consume when used, preventing infinite healing exploit

### 5. Inventory UI: Quantity Indicators
- **User Experience Issue**: No visual indication of item quantities in stacked consumables
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added quantity display for stackable items: `Health Potion x3`
  - Only shows when `item.stackable = true` AND `item.quantity > 1`
  - Styled with subtle gray color using `.item-quantity` CSS class
- **Player Setup Improvement**: Changed from 3 separate potions to 1 stack of 3 potions
- **Benefits**: Clear inventory management, space efficiency, real-time quantity updates

### 6. Technical Architecture Insights
- **Item System Flaw**: The `clone()` method in base `Item` class doesn't preserve subclass behavior
- **Design Decision**: Implemented functional workaround rather than deep architectural refactor
- **Future Consideration**: Item inheritance system needs fundamental redesign for proper polymorphism
- **Current State**: All consumable functionality works correctly despite inheritance limitations

### 7. Quality Assurance
- **Testing Coverage**: Verified healing, consumption, and UI display functions correctly
- **Debug Cleanup**: Removed all debugging code after identifying and fixing root causes
- **User Feedback**: Addressed player-reported issues with clear visual and functional improvements
- **Code Maintainability**: Added clear comments explaining workaround logic for future developers

### 8. Player Experience Impact
- **Health Management**: Potions now work reliably for tactical health recovery
- **Inventory Clarity**: Players can immediately see consumable quantities (x3, x2, x1)
- **Resource Strategy**: Proper consumption mechanics enable strategic resource management
- **System Reliability**: Eliminated confusion from broken healing and infinite potion exploits

This session resolved critical game-breaking issues while improving user experience and maintaining code stability through practical workarounds.

- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded drop messages for different loot types

### 6. Bug Resolution
- **Critical Fix**: Resolved "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'getItem')" error
- **Root Cause**: ItemManager stores database as `itemDB`, monster code was accessing `itemDatabase`
- **Solution**: Updated all monster loot references to use correct property name
- **Error Prevention**: Added defensive checks to prevent future undefined reference crashes

### 7. Balance Impact Analysis
- **Real-World Drop Rates**:
  - Normal monsters: 12.5% gold, 6.25% health potions, 0.625% equipment

## 2025-07-03 - Major Combat Balance Overhaul

### 1. Balance Changes
- **Monster Defense Multiplied by 10**: All monster defense values increased dramatically to make combat significantly more challenging
  - Giant Rat: 1 ‚Üí 10 defense
  - Giant Spider: 2 ‚Üí 20 defense  
  - Goblin: 3 ‚Üí 30 defense
  - Skeleton: 2 ‚Üí 20 defense
  - Orc Warrior: 4 ‚Üí 40 defense
  - Specter: 3 ‚Üí 30 defense

### 2. Impact Analysis
- **Combat Duration**: Fights will now take much longer, requiring more strategic thinking
- **Equipment Importance**: Player weapons and attack bonuses become crucial for effectiveness
- **Progression Gating**: Higher defense monsters will require better equipment to defeat
- **Damage Scaling**: With defense formula `effectiveDamage = Math.max(1, damage - defense)`, players need substantial attack power

### 3. Testing Notes
- Need to verify combat feels challenging but not frustrating
- May need to adjust player starting equipment or early game weapon availability
- Consider if monster health should be adjusted to compensate for longer fights

### 4. Combat Mechanics Overhaul
- **Added Hit Chance System**: Players can now miss completely or deal 0 damage
- **Miss Formula**: `missChance = min(60%, defenseRatio * 0.8)` where `defenseRatio = defense/(attack+defense)`
- **Removed Minimum Damage**: Changed `Math.max(1, damage - defense)` to `Math.max(0, damage - defense)`
- **Increased Variance**: Damage variance increased from 90-110% to 80-120%
- **Better Feedback**: Different messages for misses, armor bounces, and successful hits

### 5. Critical Equipment Bug Fix
- **Issue**: Starting items (short sword +5 attack, leather armor +2 defense) were added to inventory but not equipped
- **Impact**: Player was fighting with only 10 base attack instead of 15, making combat artificially easy
- **Fix**: Auto-equip starting weapon and armor in `giveStartingItems()` method
- **Result**: Players now properly start with equipment bonuses active

### 6. Hit Chance Balance Adjustment
- **Issue**: Miss chance formula too punishing (up to 60% miss chance), making combat frustrating
- **Fix**: Reduced miss chance from `min(60%, defenseRatio * 0.8)` to `min(25%, defenseRatio * 0.4)`
- **New Miss Chances**: Giant Rat ~13%, Giant Spider ~20%, Goblin ~23%
- **Result**: Combat more engaging, fewer frustrating whiffs

### 7. Monster Defense Rebalancing
- **Issue**: Giant Spider (20 def) and higher level monsters had defense > player attack (15), causing 0 damage hits
- **Fix**: Rebalanced all monster defense values to create proper progression:
  - Giant Rat: 10 def ‚Üí 5 damage per hit (easy)
  - Giant Spider: 20 ‚Üí 12 def ‚Üí 3 damage per hit (moderate)
  - Goblin: 30 ‚Üí 14 def ‚Üí 1 damage per hit (challenging)
  - Skeleton: 20 ‚Üí 13 def ‚Üí 2 damage per hit (moderate-hard)
  - Orc Warrior: 40 ‚Üí 16 def ‚Üí needs equipment upgrades
  - Specter: 30 ‚Üí 15 def ‚Üí barely beatable with starting gear
- **Result**: Proper difficulty curve, all monsters beatable but progressively harder

## 2025-07-02 - Combat System Fixes & Balancing

### Issues Fixed
- **Combat Crash Bug**: Fixed `this.game.handlePlayerDeath()` not existing ‚Üí replaced with `game.stateManager.handlePlayerDeath()`
- **UI Reference Error**: Removed invalid `this.ui.addMessage()` call from Character class that was causing crashes
- **Invincible Monster Bug**: Giant Rat had defense: 500 making it invincible ‚Üí reduced to 0, then rebalanced

### Combat Improvements
- **Enhanced Combat Manager**: Added defensive programming and better error handling
- **Attack Messages**: Added "You attack the [monster] for [damage] damage!" feedback
- **Null Reference Protection**: Added checks to prevent crashes when game state is invalid

### Balance Changes
- **Player Movement**: Slowed down by 10% (moveDelay: 100ms ‚Üí 110ms) for better game feel
- **Monster Defense Rebalancing**: Increased all monster defenses by +1 to make combat more challenging
  - Giant Rat: 0 ‚Üí 1 defense
  - Giant Spider: 1 ‚Üí 2 defense  
  - Goblin: 2 ‚Üí 3 defense
  - Skeleton: 1 ‚Üí 2 defense
  - Orc Warrior: 3 ‚Üí 4 defense
  - Specter: 2 ‚Üí 3 defense

### Technical Notes
- Combat system now uses proper delegation through CombatManager
- Defense system works as: `effectiveDamage = Math.max(1, damage - defense)`
- All changes tested and working without crashes

### Next Priority Items (from roadmap)
- Monster loot drops (verify they're working)
- Improved monster AI pathfinding
- Save/Load system implementation
- Spell casting system (staves, scrolls, wands)

## Project Status Overview

### What's Working Well ‚úÖ
- Core gameplay loop (movement, combat, inventory)
- UI system with multiple screens
- Character progression and equipment
- Field of view and camera system
- Menu system with proper game initialization

### Known Issues üîß
- Monster AI could be more sophisticated
- No save/load functionality
- Limited spell/magic system
- Monster loot drops need verification

### Architecture Quality üìä
- **Code Organization**: Excellent - modular, under 500 lines per file
- **Separation of Concerns**: Good - managers handle specific systems
- **Error Handling**: Improved - added defensive programming
- **Performance**: Good - no noticeable lag or issues

## Development Guidelines

### When Adding Features
1. Keep files under 500 lines (project rule)
2. Create new modules for major systems
3. Use manager pattern for complex systems
4. Test combat interactions thoroughly
5. Update this log with rationale and impact

### When Fixing Bugs
1. Document the root cause
2. Explain the fix approach
3. Note any side effects or related changes
4. Test edge cases

### Balance Philosophy
- Early game should be accessible but not trivial
- Combat should require some strategy
- Player progression should feel meaningful
- Equipment should provide clear benefits
