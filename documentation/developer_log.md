## 2025-07-06 - Equipment Bonus System Overhaul & Amulet Health Fix

### 1. Critical Equipment Bonus Bug Discovery
- **Issue**: Amulet of Health (+15 max health) and other equipment bonuses not applying properly
- **Root Cause**: Equipment system applied bonuses directly to `maxHealth`, then `updateStats()` immediately overwrote them
- **Sequence**: `applyStats()` → `entity.maxHealth += 15` → `updateStats()` → `calculateMaxHealth()` → bonus lost
- **Impact**: All equipment health/mana bonuses were non-functional, making accessories nearly useless

### 2. Equipment Calculation System Redesign
- **Architecture Change**: Moved from direct stat modification to calculation-based approach
- **New Player Methods**:
  - `calculateMaxHealth()` - includes equipment health bonuses
  - `calculateMaxMana()` - includes equipment mana bonuses
  - Matches existing pattern of `calculateAttackPower()` and `calculateDefense()`
- **Consistency**: All equipment bonuses now calculated uniformly instead of mixed approaches

### 3. Equipment.js Stat Application Refactor
- **Removed Direct Modification**: No longer directly modifies `maxHealth` or `maxMana` properties
- **Preserved Base Stats**: Still directly modifies strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence
- **Smart Clamping**: Added health/mana clamping when equipment is unequipped
- **Clean Architecture**: Equipment effects now properly isolated from base character stats

### 4. UI Enhancement: Equipment Bonus Visibility
- **Character Screen Updates**: Added green equipment bonus indicators
  - Health: `45 / 50 (+15)` - shows amulet bonus
  - Mana: `25 / 35 (+15)` - shows staff/tome bonuses
- **Visual Feedback**: Players can now see equipment bonuses working in real-time
- **Debugging Aid**: Makes it easy to verify equipment effects are applying correctly

### 5. Technical Implementation Details
- **Defensive Programming**: Added proper error handling for equipment bonus calculations
- **Equipment Iteration**: Safely loops through all equipped items to sum bonuses
- **Performance**: Minimal impact - calculations only run when stats update
- **Backwards Compatibility**: All existing equipment continues to work without changes

### 6. Equipment Balance Impact
- **Amulet of Health**: Now properly provides +15 max health + constitution bonus
- **Spell Tome**: +15 max mana bonus now functional
- **Staff**: +10 max mana bonus now applies correctly
- **Accessory Value**: Equipment slots now provide meaningful character progression
- **Strategic Depth**: Players can now build characters around equipment bonuses

### 7. Bug Resolution Process
- **Problem Identification**: User reported amulet health bonus not working
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Traced through equipment system to find stat overwriting

## 2025-07-05 - Critical Health Potion System Fixes & Inventory UI Improvements

### 1. Player Entity Initialization Bug
- **Issue**: Player character had `undefined` name property causing "undefined uses Health Potion" messages
- **Root Cause**: Character constructor didn't set a name property, Player constructor inherited this issue
- **Fix**: Added `this.name = 'Player'` to Player constructor after calling `super()`
- **Impact**: All entity references now display correctly in combat and item usage messages

### 2. Health Potion Inheritance System Breakdown
- **Critical Discovery**: Item inheritance system was fundamentally broken due to cloning process
- **Issue**: `ItemDatabase.getItem()` calls `item.clone()` which creates base `Item` instances, not `HealthPotion` instances
- **Result**: `HealthPotion.use()` method never gets called - only base `Item.use()` executes
- **Implications**: All specialized item behavior (healing, consumption) was non-functional

### 3. Health Potion Functionality Restoration
- **Problem**: Healing code was previously removed as "duplicate" but was actually the only working healing
- **Solution**: Restored direct healing logic in `Player.useItemFromInventory()`:
  - `this.health = Math.min(this.health + item.stats.healAmount, this.maxHealth)`
  - Added mana restoration: `this.mana = Math.min(this.mana + item.stats.manaRestore, this.maxMana)`
- **Workaround**: Bypassed broken inheritance by implementing functionality directly in player class

### 4. Item Consumption System Fix
- **Issue**: Potions had infinite uses due to consumption logic being in unreachable `HealthPotion.use()` method
- **Solution**: Added consumption logic to `Player.useItemFromInventory()`:
  - For stackable items with quantity > 1: `item.quantity--`
  - For single items or last in stack: `this.inventory.removeItem(index)`
- **Result**: Potions now properly consume when used, preventing infinite healing exploit

### 5. Inventory UI: Quantity Indicators
- **User Experience Issue**: No visual indication of item quantities in stacked consumables
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added quantity display for stackable items: `Health Potion x3`
  - Only shows when `item.stackable = true` AND `item.quantity > 1`
  - Styled with subtle gray color using `.item-quantity` CSS class
- **Player Setup Improvement**: Changed from 3 separate potions to 1 stack of 3 potions
- **Benefits**: Clear inventory management, space efficiency, real-time quantity updates

### 6. Technical Architecture Insights
- **Item System Flaw**: The `clone()` method in base `Item` class doesn't preserve subclass behavior
- **Design Decision**: Implemented functional workaround rather than deep architectural refactor
- **Future Consideration**: Item inheritance system needs fundamental redesign for proper polymorphism
- **Current State**: All consumable functionality works correctly despite inheritance limitations

### 7. Quality Assurance
- **Testing Coverage**: Verified healing, consumption, and UI display functions correctly
- **Debug Cleanup**: Removed all debugging code after identifying and fixing root causes
- **User Feedback**: Addressed player-reported issues with clear visual and functional improvements
- **Code Maintainability**: Added clear comments explaining workaround logic for future developers

### 8. Player Experience Impact
- **Health Management**: Potions now work reliably for tactical health recovery
- **Inventory Clarity**: Players can immediately see consumable quantities (x3, x2, x1)
- **Resource Strategy**: Proper consumption mechanics enable strategic resource management
- **System Reliability**: Eliminated confusion from broken healing and infinite potion exploits

This session resolved critical game-breaking issues while improving user experience and maintaining code stability through practical workarounds.

## 2025-07-03 - Major Combat Balance Overhaul

### 1. Balance Changes
- **Monster Defense Multiplied by 10**: All monster defense values increased dramatically to make combat significantly more challenging
  - Giant Rat: 1 → 10 defense
  - Giant Spider: 2 → 20 defense  
  - Goblin: 3 → 30 defense
  - Skeleton: 2 → 20 defense
  - Orc Warrior: 4 → 40 defense
  - Specter: 3 → 30 defense

### 2. Impact Analysis
- **Combat Duration**: Fights will now take much longer, requiring more strategic thinking
- **Equipment Importance**: Player weapons and attack bonuses become crucial for effectiveness
- **Progression Gating**: Higher defense monsters will require better equipment to defeat
- **Damage Scaling**: With defense formula `effectiveDamage = Math.max(1, damage - defense)`, players need substantial attack power

### 3. Testing Notes
- Need to verify combat feels challenging but not frustrating
- May need to adjust player starting equipment or early game weapon availability
- Consider if monster health should be adjusted to compensate for longer fights

### 4. Combat Mechanics Overhaul
- **Added Hit Chance System**: Players can now miss completely or deal 0 damage
- **Miss Formula**: `missChance = min(60%, defenseRatio * 0.8)` where `defenseRatio = defense/(attack+defense)`
- **Removed Minimum Damage**: Changed `Math.max(1, damage - defense)` to `Math.max(0, damage - defense)`
- **Increased Variance**: Damage variance increased from 90-110% to 80-120%
- **Better Feedback**: Different messages for misses, armor bounces, and successful hits

### 5. Critical Equipment Bug Fix
- **Issue**: Starting items (short sword +5 attack, leather armor +2 defense) were added to inventory but not equipped
- **Impact**: Player was fighting with only 10 base attack instead of 15, making combat artificially easy
- **Fix**: Auto-equip starting weapon and armor in `giveStartingItems()` method
- **Result**: Players now properly start with equipment bonuses active

### 6. Hit Chance Balance Adjustment
- **Issue**: Miss chance formula too punishing (up to 60% miss chance), making combat frustrating
- **Fix**: Reduced miss chance from `min(60%, defenseRatio * 0.8)` to `min(25%, defenseRatio * 0.4)`
- **New Miss Chances**: Giant Rat ~13%, Giant Spider ~20%, Goblin ~23%
- **Result**: Combat more engaging, fewer frustrating whiffs

### 7. Monster Defense Rebalancing
- **Issue**: Giant Spider (20 def) and higher level monsters had defense > player attack (15), causing 0 damage hits
- **Fix**: Rebalanced all monster defense values to create proper progression:
  - Giant Rat: 10 def → 5 damage per hit (easy)
  - Giant Spider: 20 → 12 def → 3 damage per hit (moderate)
  - Goblin: 30 → 14 def → 1 damage per hit (challenging)
  - Skeleton: 20 → 13 def → 2 damage per hit (moderate-hard)
  - Orc Warrior: 40 → 16 def → needs equipment upgrades
  - Specter: 30 → 15 def → barely beatable with starting gear
- **Result**: Proper difficulty curve, all monsters beatable but progressively harder
