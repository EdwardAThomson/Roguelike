# Developer Log - Modern Rogue

This log tracks updates, fixes, and development decisions made during the game's development.

## 2025-07-03 - Major Combat Balance Overhaul

### 1. Balance Changes
- **Monster Defense Multiplied by 10**: All monster defense values increased dramatically to make combat significantly more challenging
  - Giant Rat: 1 â†’ 10 defense
  - Giant Spider: 2 â†’ 20 defense  
  - Goblin: 3 â†’ 30 defense
  - Skeleton: 2 â†’ 20 defense
  - Orc Warrior: 4 â†’ 40 defense
  - Specter: 3 â†’ 30 defense

### 2. Impact Analysis
- **Combat Duration**: Fights will now take much longer, requiring more strategic thinking
- **Equipment Importance**: Player weapons and attack bonuses become crucial for effectiveness
- **Progression Gating**: Higher defense monsters will require better equipment to defeat
- **Damage Scaling**: With defense formula `effectiveDamage = Math.max(1, damage - defense)`, players need substantial attack power

### 3. Testing Notes
- Need to verify combat feels challenging but not frustrating
- May need to adjust player starting equipment or early game weapon availability
- Consider if monster health should be adjusted to compensate for longer fights

### 4. Combat Mechanics Overhaul
- **Added Hit Chance System**: Players can now miss completely or deal 0 damage
- **Miss Formula**: `missChance = min(60%, defenseRatio * 0.8)` where `defenseRatio = defense/(attack+defense)`
- **Removed Minimum Damage**: Changed `Math.max(1, damage - defense)` to `Math.max(0, damage - defense)`
- **Increased Variance**: Damage variance increased from 90-110% to 80-120%
- **Better Feedback**: Different messages for misses, armor bounces, and successful hits

### 5. Critical Equipment Bug Fix
- **Issue**: Starting items (short sword +5 attack, leather armor +2 defense) were added to inventory but not equipped
- **Impact**: Player was fighting with only 10 base attack instead of 15, making combat artificially easy
- **Fix**: Auto-equip starting weapon and armor in `giveStartingItems()` method
- **Result**: Players now properly start with equipment bonuses active

### 6. Hit Chance Balance Adjustment
- **Issue**: Miss chance formula too punishing (up to 60% miss chance), making combat frustrating
- **Fix**: Reduced miss chance from `min(60%, defenseRatio * 0.8)` to `min(25%, defenseRatio * 0.4)`
- **New Miss Chances**: Giant Rat ~13%, Giant Spider ~20%, Goblin ~23%
- **Result**: Combat more engaging, fewer frustrating whiffs

### 7. Monster Defense Rebalancing
- **Issue**: Giant Spider (20 def) and higher level monsters had defense > player attack (15), causing 0 damage hits
- **Fix**: Rebalanced all monster defense values to create proper progression:
  - Giant Rat: 10 def â†’ 5 damage per hit (easy)
  - Giant Spider: 20 â†’ 12 def â†’ 3 damage per hit (moderate)
  - Goblin: 30 â†’ 14 def â†’ 1 damage per hit (challenging)
  - Skeleton: 20 â†’ 13 def â†’ 2 damage per hit (moderate-hard)
  - Orc Warrior: 40 â†’ 16 def â†’ needs equipment upgrades
  - Specter: 30 â†’ 15 def â†’ barely beatable with starting gear
- **Result**: Proper difficulty curve, all monsters beatable but progressively harder

## 2025-07-02 - Combat System Fixes & Balancing

### Issues Fixed
- **Combat Crash Bug**: Fixed `this.game.handlePlayerDeath()` not existing â†’ replaced with `game.stateManager.handlePlayerDeath()`
- **UI Reference Error**: Removed invalid `this.ui.addMessage()` call from Character class that was causing crashes
- **Invincible Monster Bug**: Giant Rat had defense: 500 making it invincible â†’ reduced to 0, then rebalanced

### Combat Improvements
- **Enhanced Combat Manager**: Added defensive programming and better error handling
- **Attack Messages**: Added "You attack the [monster] for [damage] damage!" feedback
- **Null Reference Protection**: Added checks to prevent crashes when game state is invalid

### Balance Changes
- **Player Movement**: Slowed down by 10% (moveDelay: 100ms â†’ 110ms) for better game feel
- **Monster Defense Rebalancing**: Increased all monster defenses by +1 to make combat more challenging
  - Giant Rat: 0 â†’ 1 defense
  - Giant Spider: 1 â†’ 2 defense  
  - Goblin: 2 â†’ 3 defense
  - Skeleton: 1 â†’ 2 defense
  - Orc Warrior: 3 â†’ 4 defense
  - Specter: 2 â†’ 3 defense

### Technical Notes
- Combat system now uses proper delegation through CombatManager
- Defense system works as: `effectiveDamage = Math.max(1, damage - defense)`
- All changes tested and working without crashes

### Next Priority Items (from roadmap)
- Monster loot drops (verify they're working)
- Improved monster AI pathfinding
- Save/Load system implementation
- Spell casting system (staves, scrolls, wands)

## Project Status Overview

### What's Working Well âœ…
- Core gameplay loop (movement, combat, inventory)
- UI system with multiple screens
- Character progression and equipment
- Field of view and camera system
- Menu system with proper game initialization

### Known Issues ðŸ”§
- Monster AI could be more sophisticated
- No save/load functionality
- Limited spell/magic system
- Monster loot drops need verification

### Architecture Quality ðŸ“Š
- **Code Organization**: Excellent - modular, under 500 lines per file
- **Separation of Concerns**: Good - managers handle specific systems
- **Error Handling**: Improved - added defensive programming
- **Performance**: Good - no noticeable lag or issues

## Development Guidelines

### When Adding Features
1. Keep files under 500 lines (project rule)
2. Create new modules for major systems
3. Use manager pattern for complex systems
4. Test combat interactions thoroughly
5. Update this log with rationale and impact

### When Fixing Bugs
1. Document the root cause
2. Explain the fix approach
3. Note any side effects or related changes
4. Test edge cases

### Balance Philosophy
- Early game should be accessible but not trivial
- Combat should require some strategy
- Player progression should feel meaningful
- Equipment should provide clear benefits
