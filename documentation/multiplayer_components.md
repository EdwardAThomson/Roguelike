# Project Assessment: Components to Modify for Multiplayer

Looking at your roguelike game's current structure, here are the key components that will need modification to support multiplayer functionality:

## Game State Components

1. **World/Dungeon Generation System**
   - Current: `Dungeon.js` and `WorldManager.js` handle local generation
   - Modifications needed:
     - Server-side dungeon generation
     - Synchronization of dungeon layout to all players
     - Handling multiple players in the same dungeon section

2. **Player Entity**
   - Current: `Player.js` manages a single local player
   - Modifications needed:
     - Player identification system
     - Network representation of other players
     - Player state synchronization
     - Collision handling between players

3. **Monster Management**
   - Current: `MonsterDatabase.js` and monster entities
   - Modifications needed:
     - Server-authoritative monster AI
     - Shared monster state across clients
     - Handling multiple players attacking the same monster

4. **Item System**
   - Current: `ItemManager.js` and related item classes
   - Modifications needed:
     - Server-side item tracking
     - Item ownership and transfer between players
     - Shared/instanced loot rules

5. **Combat System**
   - Current: Combat logic in `main.js` and entity classes
   - Modifications needed:
     - Server validation of attacks
     - Damage calculation on server
     - Synchronizing combat results to all players

## UI Components

1. **Game UI**
   - Current: `UI.js` and related UI components
   - Modifications needed:
     - Player list display
     - Chat interface
     - Multiplayer-specific controls
     - Game session/lobby UI

2. **Input Handling**
   - Current: `InputHandler.js`
   - Modifications needed:
     - Client-side prediction
     - Input buffering for network latency
     - Reconciliation with server state

## Core Game Loop

1. **Game Loop**
   - Current: Main game loop in `main.js`
   - Modifications needed:
     - Separate rendering from game logic
     - Network state integration
     - Handling of server updates

2. **Game State Management**
   - Current: Game state in `RogueGame` class
   - Modifications needed:
     - Client/server state separation
     - State synchronization protocol
     - Conflict resolution

## Required Backend APIs

Based on these components, you'll need the following backend APIs:

1. **Authentication API**
   - User registration
   - Login/logout
   - Session management

2. **Game Session API**
   - Create/join/leave game sessions
   - List available games
   - Game configuration

3. **World State API**
   - Dungeon layout synchronization
   - Entity position updates
   - Game event broadcasting

4. **Player Interaction API**
   - Combat actions
   - Item trading
   - Chat messages

5. **Game Persistence API**
   - Save/load character progress
   - World state persistence
   - Leaderboards/statistics

## Multiplayer Interaction Model

For your roguelike game, I recommend starting with a **cooperative PvE model**:
- Players explore dungeons together
- Shared monster encounters
- Individual or shared loot (configurable)
- Optional PvP in designated areas (future enhancement)

This approach allows you to focus on the core synchronization challenges while providing an engaging multiplayer experience that builds on your existing game mechanics.

## Next Steps

1. Begin by creating a detailed data model for network synchronization
2. Identify which game logic must be server-authoritative vs. client-predictive
3. Design the WebSocket message protocol for real-time updates
4. Create a prototype of the basic player movement synchronization
