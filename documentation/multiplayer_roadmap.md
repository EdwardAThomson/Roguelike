## 1. Project Assessment
- [x] Review current codebase structure
- [ ] Identify components that need to be modified for multiplayer
- [ ] Document game state that needs to be synchronized
- [ ] Define multiplayer interaction model (cooperative, competitive, etc.)
- [ ] Create a list of required backend APIs

## 2. Infrastructure Setup
- [x] Create Digital Ocean account (if not already done)
- [x] Choose appropriate droplet size based on expected traffic
- [x] Set up Ubuntu server (recommended: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)
- [x] Configure SSH access and basic security
- [ ] Install necessary software:
  - [ ] Node.js and npm
  - [ ] Nginx as reverse proxy
  - [ ] MongoDB or PostgreSQL (depending on data structure needs)
  - [ ] PM2 for process management
- [ ] Set up domain name and configure DNS
- [ ] Configure SSL with Let's Encrypt

## 3. Backend Development
- [ ] Create Node.js Express server
- [ ] Implement WebSocket server using Socket.io
- [ ] Design RESTful API endpoints:
  - [ ] User management
  - [ ] Game state management
  - [ ] Leaderboards/statistics
- [ ] Implement server-side game logic:
  - [ ] Dungeon generation
  - [ ] Monster AI
  - [ ] Combat resolution
  - [ ] Item management
- [ ] Create synchronization protocol for real-time updates
- [ ] Implement server-side validation to prevent cheating

## 4. Frontend Modifications
- [ ] Refactor game code to separate:
  - [ ] Rendering logic (client-side)
  - [ ] Game state (server-authoritative)
  - [ ] Input handling (client captures, server validates)
- [ ] Add network layer to client:
  - [ ] WebSocket connection management
  - [ ] State synchronization
  - [ ] Error handling and reconnection logic
- [ ] Implement client-side prediction for responsive movement
- [ ] Add multiplayer UI elements:
  - [ ] Player list
  - [ ] Chat functionality
  - [ ] Lobby/game creation interface

## 5. Database Implementation
- [ ] Design database schema:
  - [ ] User accounts
  - [ ] Character progression
  - [ ] Game world persistence
  - [ ] Item inventories
- [ ] Set up database on Digital Ocean
- [ ] Implement database connection in backend
- [ ] Create data access layer
- [ ] Implement caching strategy for frequently accessed data

## 6. Authentication System
- [ ] Implement user registration and login
- [ ] Set up JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication
- [ ] Create password reset functionality
- [ ] Implement session management
- [ ] Add role-based access control (player vs. admin)

## 7. Multiplayer Features
- [ ] Implement player presence detection
- [ ] Create game session management
- [ ] Develop real-time player position synchronization
- [ ] Add player interaction mechanics:
  - [ ] Trading
  - [ ] Cooperative combat
  - [ ] Chat system
- [ ] Implement latency compensation techniques

## 8. Deployment Process
- [ ] Set up Git repository for version control
- [ ] Create deployment scripts
- [ ] Configure Nginx as reverse proxy:
  - [ ] Static file serving
  - [ ] API routing
  - [ ] WebSocket proxying
- [ ] Set up PM2 process management
- [ ] Create CI/CD pipeline (optional):
  - [ ] Automated testing
  - [ ] Deployment on push to main branch
- [ ] Deploy initial version to staging environment
- [ ] Test thoroughly before production deployment

## 9. Testing
- [ ] Develop unit tests for critical components
- [ ] Create integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Implement end-to-end testing for game flows
- [ ] Perform load testing to determine scaling needs
- [ ] Test under various network conditions:
  - [ ] High latency
  - [ ] Packet loss
  - [ ] Disconnections

## 10. Monitoring and Maintenance
- [ ] Set up logging system
- [ ] Implement error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
- [ ] Configure server monitoring (CPU, memory, disk usage)
- [ ] Create automated backups for database
- [ ] Develop update strategy for future releases
- [ ] Document maintenance procedures
